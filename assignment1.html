            Here is my gif for assignment 1! It shows all the LEDs blinking individually.

            Here is my schematic for assignment 1! The schematic shows how my circuit board should be connected.

            </p>
            <p>
            Here is my math for how I chose the proper resistance to use. I chose to use 220 ohms of resistance for all the LED lights because that is higher than the minimum resistance allowed.

            <h>
            This is the code I used to make my the LEDs on my arduino blink!
