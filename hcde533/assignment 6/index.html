            <p>
                This was my original idea for a lamp, but instead of the laser printed bottom I decided I wanted to take advantage of the organic shapes the rhino is supposedly so good for.

            <p>
                I was inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22VllkNdhYg" target="_blank">this video</a>
            </p>
            <img src="a6diagram.png" width=800></a> 
           
            <p>
                So I was tring to make a lamp bottom like the in picture, but I could not get the flat design to wrap fully around and become a closed cylinder. I tried to do this for many many many hours and then 
                decided to change course.
            </p>

            <p>
                I decided I wanted print something off thingiverse, and <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:19104" target="_blank">this lamp</a> is what I found that I liked.
            </p>
            <img src="thingiverselamp.png" width=800></a> 

            <p>
                So I started design a base to put the lightbulb in, and I started printing it, I don't know why because I very quickly realized that printing the lamp off 
                thingiverse would take 1 day and 23 hours and I literally did not have that much time because I procrastinated. So I canceled the base print but I had this disk 
                and it inspired my new idea.

            <p>
                My new idea was to print off a bunch of these pentagons and hot glue them together to make a thin dodecahedran and the light shine through. Note: I did not use any 
                glue to attach the lamp innerds to the 3d printed part. I only used glue to put the 3d printed parts together. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Here are some pentagon tests I made.
            </p>
            <img src="examplepentagons.jpg" width=800></a> 

            <p>
                Then I had the idea to combine what I had tried to do before with the cool patterns with my new idea of a dodecahedran lamp.

            <p>
                Using the pentagon tests to determine the proper size, this is what I decided to be the final design. Only one of the pentagons would have

            <p>
                I taped parts of the lamp to my desk in order to glue on the other sides.
            </p>

            <p>
                I liked how it looked, but I realized that the way I was planning for the light to stay on wouldn't really work because then you wouldn't be able to take it out.
            </p>
            <img src="lampprogresswithlight.jpg" width=800></a> 

            <p>
                The light part has this plastic nut to screw it onto the original light fixture (I took the innerds from an idea lamp) so I thought I could glue it to the outside 
                of the lamp fixture. But it would not stay on.
            </p>
            <img src="capnostayon.jpg width=800></a> 

            <p>
                I observed that the ikea plastic couldn't be hot glued but the PLA could, so I had the amazing idea of making my own nut that would screw on! (Was not actually a good 
                idea).
            </p>
            <img src="pentagoncap.jpg" width=800></a>

            <p>
                The first time I printed it was too small I had to do it again. Meanwhile I am still printing and glueing pentagons.
            </p>

            <p>
                So it turns printing something that will screw onto a preesxisting object is very hard (woah!) so even at the right size it didn't totally work, but I realized 
                the light could just be shoved into the nut (no screwing) and it stayed so that is how I attached the innerds to the outer ficture. I also printed off some 
                cylinders to cover the ugly ikdea plastic attached to the lightbulb. And here is my final lamp!

                And here is a fancy picture of the lamp!

                I am going to make a candle of the little ghost with a top hot I made last week. I know people who make candles out of 3d printed molds so I know it's possible.
