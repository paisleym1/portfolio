              Part 1: Ideation

            <p>
                This was my original idea for a lamp, but instead of the laser printed bottom I decided I wanted to take advantage of the organic shapes the rhino is supposedly so good for.

            <p>
                I was inspired by <a> href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22VllkNdhYg">this</a> video, and made this design for a lamp.

            <p>
                So I was tring to make a lamp bottom like the in picture, but I could not get the flat design to wrap fully around and become a closed cylinder. I tried to do this for many many many hours and then 
                decided to change course.

            <p>
                I decided I wanted print something off thingiverse, and <a> href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:19104">this</a> is what I found that I liked.

            <p>
                So I started design a base to put the lightbulb in, and I started printing it, I don't know why because I very quickly realized that printing the lamp off 
                thingiverse would take 1 day and 23 hours and I literally did not have that much time because I procrastinated. So I canceled the base print but I had this disk 
                and it inspired my new idea.

            <p>
                My new idea was to print off a bunch of these pentagons and hot glue them together to make a thin dodecahedran and the light shine through. Note: I did not use any 
                glue to attach the lamp innerds to the 3d printed part. I only used glue to put the 3d printed parts together. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Here are some pentagon tests I made.
            </p>
            <img src="examplepentagons.png" width=800></a> 

            <p>
                Then I had the idea to combine what I had tried to do before with the cool patterns with my new idea of a dodecahedran lamp.

            <p>
                Using the pentagon tests to determine the proper size, this is what I decided to be the final design. Only one of the pentagons would have 
            </p>

            <p>
                I used super glue to put the 3D printed parts together, not to keep the light part attached to the lamp.
