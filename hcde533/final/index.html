            <p>When I found out I'd need to buy a 3D printer for this class, I immediately began thinking of things I could and give out as presents. When we did the lamp
               assignment, I actually really liked my lamp and thought it can out really well. After that project was finished, I was thinking about ways I could travel with 
              a bunch of lamps to give to family members over winter break. I knew the lamp I'd made before would fit very well in a suitcase. So after much pondering I thought
               what if I assembled the lamps when I get to travel destination? But then I realized that my family members would have the exact same problem about lamps fitting 
              in suitcases, and I also did not want to spend my entire vacation hot glueing. So then I thought what if my family members assembled the lamps themselves when they 
              got home? But I didn't think any of them would actually take the time to hot glue the pieces togethers, so that wouldn't work either. More determined than ever not 
              to spend money on gifts for my family, I pondered longer. Then, it hit me: what if the lamp could click together like legos? Then it could be a lamp and a fun project! 
              So that's what inspired me to do this.</p>
          
            <p>Side Note: It was recently pointed out to me that I will need to spend money on these gifts because I need to supply the actual lamp part of the lamp and not just the 
              shade. While this is dissapointing, it did not dampen my excitement around doing this.</p>
        
            <p>Initially I thought I'd mak pentagons that fit together like in Assignment 4, but Professor Nadya pointed out that might be difficult to assemble. So Sherry Wang 
            sent me her work from assignment 2, showing how she used what I will be calling "clips" (for lack of a better word) to how cardboard pieces together. I really liked that 
             ideas, but I didn't really like how the cardboard stuck out from the shape. So I decided I would make a clip you can put right on the tips of the vertices of to hold it 
            together. I thought that might be less obvious.</p>

            <pAfter taking everything in, I landed on this design concept, where I could repurpose my grasshopper from assignment 2.</p>

            <p>I started with the most important part: the pentagon. In assignment 2, the slits had been on the sides of the shape. I needed to move the slits to the viertices 
            of the shape. After a LOT of math (special thanks to Harish Chandra Rajpoot on math.stackexchange.com for answering a random question seven years ago) I got the slits 
            on the vertices and I was very proud of myself.</p>

            <p>I was really happy with how the mold molds turned out. The only issue I saw were these little pointy specks on some of the surface, but I was able to scratch 
            off most of it.</p>
            <img src="step8.jpg" width=800></a>

            <p>The next was to make the actual mold. I mixed together my Oomoo silicon/rubber material and poured it into the 3d printed mold molds. I left it to harden overnight.</p>
            <img src="step11.jpg" width=800></a>

            <p>I was really excited to take the actual mold out of the mold mold. I was really happy with how it turned out, but it was at this point I began to realize 
            how skinny the brim of the ghost's hat is. I was a little concerned about how that would work out.</p>
            <img src="step12.jpg" width=800></a>

            <p>I wanted to make a candle using my mold, so I found some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-B66FPG03s" target="_blank">instructions here</a> 
                and went ahead with melting the candle wax.</p>
            <img src="step13.jpg" width=800></a>

            <p>When the wax was fully melted, I poured it into the mold and added a candle wick.</p>
            <img src="step14.jpg" width=800></a>

            <p>And here is the candle! As I had worried the brim of the top hat didnt work out very well, but the ghost still is very cute. In the future I will be more 
            considerate of the width of different parts of the mold. Perhaps next I will make a pacman ghost wearing a beanie, as those do not have any parts that stick 
            out as much as the top hat.</p>

            <p>I made three more candles, and then one out of ice. None of the candle hat brims worked out very well, but the ice hat brim did.</p>
