        <div class="container">
            <p>For this assignment I will make a lamp similar to the one I made before, except this time I will use Grasshopper to design the pentagons. When I made my lamp 
                before, I had to use hot glue to connect the pentagons and it took a lot of time. For this assignment, I will make it so each pentagon piece can snap together 
                using fingerjoints/boxjoints, tabs, or another joining method. When complete, the pentagons will made made a dodecahedran shape and will hang on a light.</p>

        <p>The lamp will be used create light in a fun and cool looking way.</p>
        
        <h3>Timeline</h3>
        <p>I will model the pentagons over thanksgiving break, and begin the printing and testing on Nov 28. If I end up running out of time for printing 
            I will render the lamp in Rhino instead. If I have surplus time, I might render the lamp in Rhino3d.</p>
