            <p>For this assignment I will make a lamp similar to <a href="https://paisleymaschmeier.github.io/portfolio/hcde533/assignment%206/finallampfancypicture!.jpg" 
                target="_blank">the one I made before</a>, except this time I will use Grasshopper to design the pentagons. In assignment six (Lamps!) I used hot glue to 
                connect the pentagons and it took a lot of time to assemble. For this assignment, I will make it so each pentagon piece can snap together using 
                fingerjoints/boxjoints, tabs, or another joining method. I will accompish this combining the puzzle box from assignment 3 and the lamp from assignment 7. 
                When complete, the pentagons will make up a dodecahedran shape and will hang on a light.</p>
        
            <h3>Techniques</h3>

                  <ul>Rhino Modeling</ul>
                  <ul>Grasshopper</ul>
                  <ul>3d Printing</ul>

            <p>The lamp will be used create light in a fun and cool looking way.</p>

            <h3>Timeline</h3>
            <p>I will model the pentagons over thanksgiving break, and begin the printing and testing fits on Nov 28. I will complete building the lamp on Dec 2, and spend the 
                remainder of my time documenting everything on my website. I will also be documenting as I work through this project. If I end up running out of time for printing I 
                will render the lamp in Rhino3d instead. If I have surplus time, I might render the lamp as well as print it.</p>
