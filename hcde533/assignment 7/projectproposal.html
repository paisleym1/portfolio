        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <p>For this assignment I will design a lamp using Grasshopper. In assignment 6 (Lamps!) I designed a lamp made up of pentagons and used hot glue to put 
                it together, but that took a lot of time. For this assignment, I will make it so each pentagon interlocks with another and clasps together using 
                fingerjoints/boxjoints, tabs, or another joining method. I designed an interlocking pieces box for assignment 4, and this project will basically be a 
                cross between that assignment and the lamp I made for assignment 6. When complete, the pentagons will make up a dodecahedran shape and will hang on a 
                lightbulb. The lamp will be used create light in a fun and cool looking way. You will be able to take is places easily because it can deconstruct into 
                smaller, storable pieces.</p>

            <h3>Techniques</h3>
             <ul>
                  <li>Rhino Modeling</li>
                  <li>Grasshopper</li>
                  <li>3d Printing</li>
                  <li>Interference Fits</li>
                  <li>Incorporating Stock Parts</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Timeline</h3>
            <p>I will model the pentagons over thanksgiving break, and begin the printing and testing fits on Nov 28. I will complete building the lamp on Dec 2, and spend the 
                remainder of my time documenting everything on my website. I will also be documenting as I work through this project.</p>
            
            <h3>Bill of Materials</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Filament (already obtained)</li>
                <li>3D Printer (already obtained)</li>
                <li>Lightbulb and portable socket (already obtained)</li>
                <li>A can-do attitude (will obtain ASAP)</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Use Grasshopper to made a model where you can change the number of sides of the pieces and it will give you the proper shapes 
                    needed to make an enclosed container. This is actually what I had wanted to do for assignment 4, but when I realized the angles of every edge would need to 
                    change according to the type of shape I opted not to.</li>
                <li>Render the lamp on Rhino and make Nadya guess which one is real.</li>
