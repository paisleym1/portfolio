            <p>First thing I did was remodel my Ghost Wearing A Top Hat, because the old one had an inconsistent number of polygons. I used a ghost off thingiverse and 
            modeled the hat myself. The final object is a "good" mesh. I made sure to keep the parts from each step so I could go back and change something if I needed to.</p>

            <p>Next, I began creating the box that would be the mold for my mold. I cut the ghosts in half and used the Align tools to properly place each ghost half in the 
            box, which I learned how to do from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_8sfUzAF8o" target="_blank">this youtube video.</a>
            I used boolean union to combine objects.</p>
            <img src="step2.png" width=800></a>

            <p>Next I added the whole in the top to put the material into, and some small hemispheres to help with aligning. After I combined everything using Mesh Boolean 
            Union and ensure that both pieces were in fact good meshes, I was ready to start printing.</p>

            <p>I printed the mold molds by convirting the 3dm file into an stl, and then converting that into a geo file using Cura. On Cura I used all default settings and 
            Super Quality. The molds took approximately 18 hours to print.</p>

            <p>I was really happy with how the mold molds turned out. The only issue I saw were these little pointy specks on some of the surface, but I was able to scratch 
            off most of it.</p>
            <img src="step8.jpg" width=800></a>

            <p>The next was to make the actual mold. I mixed together my Oomoo silicon/rubber material and poured it into the 3d printed mold molds. I left it to harden overnight.</p>

            <p>I was really excited to take the actual mold out of the mold mold. I was really happy with how it turned out, but it was at this point I began to realize 
            how skinny the brim of the ghost's hat is. I was a little concerned about how that would work out.</p>
            <img src="step12.jpg" width=800></a>

            <p>I wanted to make a candle using my mold, so I found some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-B66FPG03s" target="_blank">instructions here</a> 
                and went ahead with melting the candle wax.</p>
            <img src="step13.jpg" width=800></a>

            <p>When the wax was fully melted, I poured it into the mold and added a candle wick.</p>
            <img src="step14.jpg" width=800></a>

            <p>And here is the candle! As I had worried the brim of the top hat didnt work out very well, but the ghost still is very cute. In the future I will be more 
            considerate of the width of different parts of the mold. Perhaps next I will make a pacman ghost wearing a beanie, as those do not have any parts that stick 
            out as much as the top hat.</p>
            <img src="candle.jpg" width=800></a>

            <p>I made three more candles, and then one out of ice. None of the candle hat brims worked out very well, but the ice hat brim did.</p>
