            <h2>
              Part 1: Merging Meshes
            </h2>
            <p>
                First thing I did was go to Thingiverse and download two meshes, this <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:557527" target="_blank">PacMan Ghost</a> and this <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:178683" target="_blank">Top Hat</a>. 
                I wanted to merge the Top Hat with the PacMan Ghost so that the ghost would be wearing the top hat, so I exported the two files to Rhino.  
                I reduced the polygon count of the meshes to make everything easier for me to work with.

            <p>
                Merging the two meshes proved much harder than I thought it would. The top hat is a closed mesh with a hollow space in the middle, so when I merged 
                it with the ghost it still had that empty space inside it, as well as overlapping parts. Basically, it was a bad mesh. I could not figure out how
                to fill in the top hat, so I opted to make my own since it's only two shapes and really not that complicated. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I was able to create my own top hat easily by making two solids, turning them into meshes, and then using MeshBooleanUnion. I also sized it so it was look 
                good on the ghost's head.
            </p>

            <p>
                I decided to get a little creative and cut the top off the ghost where I wanted the top hat to go. I did this by cover the part I wanted to keep with the 
                top hat and using MeshTrim, with the hat as my cutting object and the ghost to be cut. I'm now realizing I probably did not need to do this but I the time 
                I thought it was necessary. 
            </p>
            <img src="step4.png" width=800></a> 
            <p>
                Because I cut the top off my ghost, it was no longer a closed mesh, so I used Cap to close it off.
            </p>
            <img src="step5.png" width=800></a> 
            <p>
                After that I used MeshBooleanUnion again to merge the ghost with the top hat.
            </p>

            <p>
                I made sure the <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:557527" target="_blank">Ghost Wearing a Top Hat</a> passed the checks for rapid prototyping 
                by checking the Object Description. As you can see in the image, they are a Valid Mesh.
            </p>

            <p>
                I also checked the Mesh Repair, where I can confirm that This is a Good Mesh.

                Ghost is so happy with their top hat!!
