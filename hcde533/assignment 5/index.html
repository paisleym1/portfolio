            <h1>Paisley Maschmeier's Assignment 5: Getting Meshy!</h1>
            <h2>
              Part 1: Merging Meshes
            </h2>
            <p>
                First thing I did was go to Thingiverse and download two meshes, this <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:557527" target="_blank"><p>PacMan Ghost</p></a> and this <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:178683" target="_blank"><p>Top Hat</p></a>. 
                I wanted to merge the Top Hat with the PacMan Ghost so that the ghost would be wearing the top hat, so I exported the two files to Rhino.  
                I reduced the polygon count of the meshes to make everything easier for me to work with.

            <p>
                Merging the two meshes proved much harder than I thought it would. The top hat is a closed mesh with a hollow space in the middle, so when I merged 
                it with the ghost it still had that empty space inside it, as well as overlapping parts. Basically, it was a bad mesh. I could not figure out how
                to fill in the top hat, so I opted to make my own since it's only two shapes and really not that complicated.

            <p>
                I was able to create my own top hat easily by making two solids, turning them into meshes, and then using MeshBooleanUnion. I also sized it so it was look 
                good on the ghost's head.
