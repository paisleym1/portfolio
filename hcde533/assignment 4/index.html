            <p>For this project I chose to do the 3D printing option. </p>
            <p>I wanted to be able to change the size of the panel and number of tabs, so I made grasshopper program to do that. I started with a square and added boxes around
            it. The program actually makes two different types of panels that fit together to form the box. I also included an "interference" variable to adjust the width of 
            of each tab.<p>
            <p>The part where I struggled was with trimming the boxes and square so that where they overlapped wouldn't have a line. I could not figure out how to do that, 
                so I had to remove the lines manually with each new iteration of my design.</p>
            
            <h2>Below is information and findings for each iteration of printing. Every trial was done on Low Quality with all default settings, aside from what is specified.</h2>
            
            <h3>Trial 1<h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Interference: 0</li>
                    <li>Infill: 100%</li>
                    <li>Top/Bottom Thickness: 0</li>
                    <li>Special Feature: None</li>
                    <li>Thoughts: For this first iteration I just wanted to see if my pieces would print properly. There was no interference on them so of course they didn't 
                        fit together. I noted that they were very dense and heavy, so 100% infill might not be necessary.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Trial 2<h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Interference: 0.15mm</li>
                    <li>Infill: 50%</li>
                    <li>Top/Bottom Thickness: 0</li>
                    <li>Special Feature: Attempt to print entirely hollow with 0.8 thickness around the edges in order to save time and filament. It didn't work.
                    <li> Thoughts: I tried to use what I had learned from my last attempt in this one. Unfortunately, my printer ran out of filament before the print was 
                        able to finish. Luckly, it has printed enough that I could put the pieces together and know that I added too much interference. I also cut each piece 
                        in half to see how it fit with itself. Again, too loose, and also I didn't like the pattern of the infill very much.</li>

                    <li>Special Feature: Large hole in middle to save time and filament</li>
                    <li> Thoughts: I experimented with different combinations of the 0.14 intference and 0 interference pieces, and found the best combination to be 
                        0.14 interference on the 4-tabbed panel, 0 interference on the tabbed panel.</li>

                    <li>Special Feature: Filament Monster</li>
                    <li>Thoughts: For this trial I tried to print out 6 0.14mm interference 5-tabbed panels. I don't know why, I only needed 6. It completely failed anyway; 
                     I left it to print overnight and I have absolutely no idea what could have happened. In the morning the print was a mess and the rubber bit on the 
                     nozzle had fallen off. I reatached it and releveled the bed. I think it may have been too low.</li>

                 <h3>Catastrophic Event</h3>
                 <p>So I woke up the next morning to find, as you just learned, a hube mess. But that's not even what was so catostrophic. The catostrophic part was that
                     I picked up the two 0.14mm interference pieces I made in trial 3, put them together, and thought "What was I thinking? These are too loose. I need to 
                     do more interpherence trials clearly." I did not look at my notes and that is the explaination for what follows.</p>
             
             <h3>Trial 5<h3>
                 <ul>
                    <li>Interference: 0.13mm and 0.12mm</li>
                    <li>Infill: 65%</li>
                    <li>Top/Bottom Thickness: 0</li>
                    <li>Special Feature: Square hole in middle and pentagonal hole in middle.
                    <li> Thoughts: These pieces printed just fine, and I decided that the 0.12mm interence panels fit together better than the 0.13mm interference panels. 
                     It did not occur to me, as it had the night before, that I could mix and match. So I decided that final thing I had to do was print 3 4-tabbed 0.12mm
                     interference panels and 3 3-tabbed 0.12mm interference panels. I also decided to go with the 65% infill, it did not looks as good but it would be a 
                     lot faster.</li>
                </ul>

             <h3>Trial 6<h3>
                 <ul>
                    <li>Interference: 0.12mm</li>
                    <li>Infill: 65%</li>
                    <li>Top/Bottom Thickness: 0.1mm</li>
                    <li>Special Feature: None
                    <li> Thoughts: In the last trial I had measured thickness of the newly printed panels and found them to each be around 0.1 or 02. For that reason I decided
                         to add a top and bottom thickness to this print. Unfortunately, I think that messed things up and the 0.14mm interference pieces won't go together very well. 
                         But they do fit very nicely with the 0 interference panels, just like what I'd observed before and then forgot. I manage to squish something together.</li>

               <h3>Second Catastrophic Event</h3>
                 <p>I am just now realizing I will need a third piece to go on the top and bottom of the cube so that it actually in enclosed.</p>

                    <li> Thoughts: I opted to use 0.15 interference and 0 Top/Bottom thickness because the pieces salvaged from trial two fit nicely into the open-ended
                      cube I have created./li>
