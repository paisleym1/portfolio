            <p>For this project I chose to do the 3D printing option. </p>
            <p>I wanted to be able to change the size of the panel and number of tabs, so I made grasshopper program to do that. I started with a square and added boxes around
            it. The program actually makes two different types of panels that fit together to form the box. I also included an "interference" variable to adjust the width of 
            of each tab.<p>
            <p>The part where I struggled was with trimming the boxes and square so that where they overlapped wouldn't have a line. I could not figure out how to do that, 
                so I had to remove the lines manually with each new iteration of my design.</p>
            
            <h2>Below is information and findings for each iteration of printing. Every trial was done on Low Quality with 2 wall thickness.</h2>
            
            <h3>Trial 1<h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Interference: 0<li/>
                    <li>Infill: 100%<li/>
                    <li>Top/Bottom Thickness: 0<li/>
                    <li> Thoughts: For this first iteration I just wanted to see if my pieces would print properly. There was no interference on them so of course they didn't 
                        fit together. I noted that they were very dense and heavy, so 100% infill might not be necessary.<li/>
