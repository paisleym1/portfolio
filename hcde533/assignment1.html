            For this assignment I wanted to make a pieces that look like ninja stars
            </h3>
            <p>
              I started by using my digital calibers to measure the thickness of the cardboard I intended to laser cut. I measured the cardboard to be 3.0 mm thick, or
                0.12 inches. 
        </p>I decided to measure millimeter measurement for my 3d model in Rhino because I will use Inkscape to export the model to a vector illustration, and Inkscape uses millimeters.
        <p>
            Next I needed to design the model of my piece in Rhino. I decided to use the millimeter measurement for my 3d model because I planned on using Inkscape to export
            the model into a vector illustration, and Inkscape uses millimeters. Download my model here:
