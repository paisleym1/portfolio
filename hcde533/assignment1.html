            <h1>Paisley Maschmeier's Assignment 1: Modelling and Laser Cutting</h1>
            <h4>
            For this assignment I wanted to make a kit that looked like a bunch of ninja stars!
            </h4>
             <h2>Part 1: Modelling </h2>       
            <p>
              I started by using my digital caliber to measure the thickness of the cardboard I intended to laser cut. I measured the cardboard to be 3.0 mm thick, or
                0.12 inches. </p>
        <p>
            Next I needed to design the model of my piece in Rhino. I decided to use the millimeter measurement for my 3d model because I planned on using Inkscape to export
            the model into a vector illustration, and Inkscape uses millimeters. Download my model here:
            <a href="https://github.com/paisleym1/hcde439/blob/main/hcde533/ninjastar.3dm" target="_blank">Ninja Star Model</a> 
         </p>
    <h4> This is was the model looks like: </h4>

        <p> After I finished the 3d model, I exported it using Inkscape from a .3dm file to a .dxf file and went to the MILL to lasercut my pieces. </p>

        <h2> Part 2: Laser Cutting </h>
        <p>After arriving at the MILL and checking out an Macbook, I used a flashdrive to transfer my files from my computer to the school computer.</p>
        <p>Upon opening my .dxf file in Adobe Illustrator, it did not look right at all. My beautiful ninja star was not there.</p>
        <h4>This is what the illustration looked like</h4>
        <img src="sidewaysstar.png" width=800></a>
        <p>After thinking about the problem for a minute, I realized that it looked this way because my model was oriented incorrectly. The 2d vector illustration was showing 
            the top of the ninja star instead of the front, where you could actually tell was it was. Using the school computer, I reoriented the model in Rhino and reexported 
            the file from .3dm to .dxt, and then opened the file on Adobe Illustrator. Using millimeters wasn't an issue because Illustrator has a millimeter 
            measurement option. I made sure to scale the vector illustration so that it maintained the proper size (110mm x 110m).</p>
            
    <h4> This is the vector illustration done correctly</h4>
        <img src="correctstar.png" width=800></a>

    <h4>.dfx file: <a href="https://github.com/paisleym1/hcde439/blob/main/hcde533/star2.dxf" target="_blank">Ninja Star Vector</a></h4>
    
    <h4>.ai file: <a href="https://github.com/paisleym1/hcde439/blob/main/hcde533/star3.ai" target="_blank">Ninja Star Adobe*</a></h4>
    
    <p>*I'm not sure if this file is the correct one, I might have saved the Adobe Illustrator file on the school computer by accident, and I can't check this 
        file because I do not have Adobe Illustrator. Just know that it looks the same as the .dxf file. </p>
    
    <p>I made sure to scale the vector illustration in Inkscape so that it 
            maintained the proper size (110mm x 110m). See the file here: <a href="https://github.com/paisleym1/hcde439/blob/main/hcde533/star3.dxf" target="_blank">Ninja Star
