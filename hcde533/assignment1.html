            <h4>
            For this assignment I wanted to make a kit that looked like a bunch of ninja stars!
            </h4>
            <p>
              I started by using my digital caliber to measure the thickness of the cardboard I intended to laser cut. I measured the cardboard to be 3.0 mm thick, or
                0.12 inches. </p>
        <p>
            Next I needed to design the model of my piece in Rhino. I decided to use the millimeter measurement for my 3d model because I planned on using Inkscape to export
            the model into a vector illustration, and Inkscape uses millimeters. Download my model here:

         </p>
    <h4> This is was the model looks like </h4>

        <p> After I finished the 3d model, I exported it from a .3dm file to a .dxf file. Then, I went to the MILL to lasercut my pieces. </p>
