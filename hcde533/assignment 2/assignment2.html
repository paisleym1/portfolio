        </div>
        
    <h4>For this assignment I still wanted to make a ninja star, but this time the pieces needed to fit together better.</h4>
        
    <p> I started out with the grasshoppper model we made in class, but I wanted it to look more like a ninja star. So I added "blades" to the ends that stuck out, 
        and added sliders to adjust the number, size, and angle of the blades. I did this by marking a point outside of the circle that I wanted the blade to reach, and
        then connecting that point witht the circle using lines.</p>

        <h4>Below are some of the shapes I was able to make with my rhino model:</h4>

    <p> I used a different cardboard for this assignment than I did in assignment 1, so I had to remeasure the thickness. Using the calipers at the MILL to measure the thickness of the cardboard, 
        I seem to be getting a measurement of anything between 3.8mm and 4.2 mm so I decided to try printer in different sizes to see what fits best.</p>
        
    <p> I started by cutting rectangles out of some scrap cardboard that were 10mm, 15mm, and 20mm tall and 3.8mm, 4mm, 4.2mm wide. I definitely cut the rectangles too close
        together, but I was still able to get a decent sense of what kind of slit worked best for holding the cardboard. I ended up going with 3.6mm x 20mm slits in my 
        ninja stars.</p>

        <h4>These are the test cuts I made</h4>

    <p> Once I had figured out those measurements, I was able to bake my shape from grasshopper and add depth to it. I decided to start with simple, small bladed 4 slit ninja star. 
        I made the ninja star 40mm in radius so that two full slits could fit across the star. </p>

<h4>4 Pointed Star Measurements</h4>
<p>- Rect width: 3.6mm</p> 
<p>- Rect height: 20mm</p> 
<p>- Circle rad: 40mm</p> 
<p>- Blade: 42mm</p> 


    <p>I then converted the rhino file to a .dxf file, and used a laptop at the MILL to open
         the .dxf file in Adobe Illustrator for cutting. I didn't need to scale the image at all, and I made sure the vectors were set to width 0.01 and color (0,0,0). </p>

   <p> I began the laser cutting with the preferences set to 100 speed, 50 power, and 50 frequency, but that didn't cut through the cardboard all the way, so I upped it to
       100 speed, 65 power, and 50 frequency, which worked very well. I started by only cutting three stars, which fit together really nicely, so I made 18 more. </p>

    <p>After I made that shape, I wanted to make a fun shape, so I decided to do some smaller 7 pointed stars.</p>

<h4>7 Pointed Star Measurements</h4>
<p>- Rect width: 3.6mm</p> 
<p>- Rect height: 10mm</p> 
<p>- Circle rad: 20mm</p> 
<p>- Blade: 14mm</p>
