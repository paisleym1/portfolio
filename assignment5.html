            <h1>Paisley's Assignment 5!</h1>
            <p>
            I was really struggling with this assignment, I broke both my transistors and the library I initially chose didn't work out as well as I thought it would for
              this assignment. That being said, I learned a lot and I feel much more equipped going forward in this class. I also ordered more resistors. 
            </p>
            <h3> Unfortunately, because of my struggles with this assignment, I do not have a gif to show, but here is an image of my circut. </h3>

            Here is my schematic for assignment 5! The schematic shows how my circuit board should be connected.

            This is my math to choose the size of resisotr I should use between the drain of the transistor and the arduino uno. Here I assumed the max current to be 30mA 
             and the volts going through the transistor to be 60.
