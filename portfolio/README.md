HCDE 310 final project
This is my final project for my HCDE 310 class

Reflection

My project changed from my initial project proposal in regard to APIs. Initially, I said I would use the 3 APIs PTV Geocoding and Places API, Nager Public Holiday API, and Sunrise Sunset API. I ended up not using the Nager Public Holiday API, and instead used the Calenderific Holiday API to achieve similar results. The issue I was having with the Nager API was that it only had public holidays in its system, meaning popular holidays like Easter and Halloween could not be searched. Furthermore, the dates associated with holidays were the official government celebration date, meaning if a holiday fell on a weekend, the date given by the API for that holiday was the nearest Friday or Monday. The Calenderific API does not have the issue and includes many non-public holidays.

I also mentioned in my project proposal that I may use a fourth API to convert given sunrise/sunset times from GMT to local time. I did end up doing that, and I used the Abstract Timezone API.
