            <h1>Paisley's Assignment 5!</h1>
            <p>
            I was really struggling with this assignment, I broke both my transistors and the library I chose didn't work out as well as I thought it would for
              this assignment. That being said, I learned a lot and I feel much more equipped going forward in this class. I also ordered more resistors. 
            </p>
            <h3> Unfortunately, because of my struggles with this assignment, I do not have a gif to show, but here is an image of my circut. </h3>
            <p>

            What I wanted was for the fan to go faster when I pushed the joystick forward, and then slow down (and eventually stop) as I pulled the joystick backwards.

            Here is my schematic for assignment 5! The schematic shows how my circuit board should be connected.

            This is my math to choose the size of resisotr I should use between the drain of the transistor and the arduino uno. Here I assumed the max current to be 30mA 
             and the volts going through the transistor to be 60.
