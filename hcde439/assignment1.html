            Here is my schematic for assignment 1! The schematic shows how my circuit board should be connected.

            <h3>
            Here is my math for how I chose the proper resistance to use. I chose to use 220 ohms of resistance for all the LED lights because that is higher 
                than the minimum resistance required.
